NucCheck is a simple website checker and a website comparer. You can enter a search string, when the string changed a notification will be send.
You can also compare a website. The program will cache the current html code and checks if the code changed.

Currently NucCheck supports e-mail notifications ( smtp server needed ) and url calls.
